                        <p>Hello virtual foodies! Welcome to the FrigginEggs Family! We are the first NFT project trying to explore how food can be linked with NFTs. While most NFT projects out there have a sci-fi/futuristic theme, we wanted to go for a more down-to-earth theme that can actually have an impact on our health, which we feel is lacking in the NFT community right now. Our team have all spent hours playing HarvestMoon (yes on that old gameboy lol) while we were young and absolutely loved it. So we wanted to bring some of these memories back while still embracing the NFT space, and giving something valuable back to the community. That is how FrigginEggs was born!</p>

                    <div class="about__section__text">
                        <h1>OUR COLLECTION</h1>
                        <p>Our NFT collectible is based on an egg, the FrigginEgg Collection. There will be 9,999 NFTs  (100 reserved for events and giveaways) and are randomly generated with  cool accessories. Every FrigginEgg is rare but some have unique items and special traits that make them super rare! We’ve spent a long time perfecting the rarity system. Some even give you passive income based on secondary sales!</p>

                        <h1>OUR GOAL</h1>
                        <p>
                            We want to build a healthier NFT community and we believe that food is the answer. Our goal is to encourage cooking and be more concious on our food choices. Why you may ask? Well the answer is very simple: <mark>We are what we eat</mark> and we believe that cooking plays a big part of being healthy, besides its a lot of fun, brings so much satisfaction and save you  money too! Our health should always be the No.1 priority no matter if you are an NFT whale or have reached financial freedom. We’d like to build a healthy and fun community to learn and share from each other, no matter the cooking experience.
                            <br /><br />
                            <mark>SPOILER ALERT!</mark>   Expect lots of fun challenges to come!!

                    If owning a dope piece of art wasn't enough, there are other benefits that come with being a FrigginEgg owner.
                    We have a few utilities and clubs which you will automatically be a part of just by owning an NFT from the collection.

                            <p>Our farm is pretty huge and in the near future we plan to give every FrigginEgg holder a piece of land as an NFT. We are still brainstorming on the idea and your feedback is important. There are many possibilities and we’d like to give something that is  valuable to the community. Should we sow some seeds? Hatch some eggs? Breed some animals? Do food workshops? Join the conversation and together we’ll try to make it happen!</p>
